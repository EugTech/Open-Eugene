# All About Open #

Part hack-a-thon, part conference, part art exhibition. We are working with learners & leaders to help citizens of Eugene open projects, improve collaboration, and inspire the community.

### Working Opwn = Open Data :: Open Software :: Open Hardware :: Open Projects ###

Participants can learn from Mozilla Open Leaders the basics of running open projects. Various local projects like KING-PONG (open hardware) and EugeneTech (open project) will be opened in real-time through the weekend in hands-on workshops. Bring your own projects and weâ€™ll help you pick the right open source or creative commons license to help share your work with the world.

## When ##
Open Eugene Fest will be happening Friday November 30th and Saturday December 1st 2018.
