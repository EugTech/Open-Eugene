# Open-Eugene
The Open Eugene Festival

This is the open repo where planning is happening be the leadership team as well as documentation, the web site, and other assets we'd like to share with the world.

## Website Development
This is an attempt at utilizing Gatsby, a React.js framework. 
This site will be following the layout of [mozillafestival.org]
and design styles from the [Gatsby Get up and Running Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial)

To get started, clone and...
    ```sh
    npm install
    gatsby develop
    ```

The `gatsby build` will make a deployable static site in the public folder. To use with github-pages, we either need a gh-pages branch, or we can put this in the docs folder on the master branch.
