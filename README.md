# Open-Eugene
The Open Eugene Festival

This is the open repo where planning is happening be the leadership team as well as documentation, the web site, and other assets we'd like to share with the world.

## Website Development
This is an attempt at utilizing Gatsby, a React.js framework. 
This site will be following the layout of [mozillafestival.org]
and design styles from the [Gatsby Get up and Running Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial)
